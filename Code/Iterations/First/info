This directory version focuses on creating a base model to train the drone to reach a target

Currently the drone is trying to reach a target immedieately in front of it
([10, 5, -10])   10 steps forward, 5 to the right, and 10 high

the drone is reamining on the street by limiting its movement in the x direction (left-toright)
street_x_min = -10
street_x_max = 10


Using a dqn network to train it:
model = DQN(
    'CnnPolicy',
    env,
    learning_rate=0.0001,
    buffer_size=10000,
    learning_starts=1000,
    batch_size=32,
    tau=0.1,
    gamma=0.99,
    train_freq=4,
    target_update_interval=1000,
    exploration_fraction=0.1,
    exploration_final_eps=0.02,
    verbose=1
)
