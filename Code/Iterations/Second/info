Using segmentation data provided by Airsim, give the agent a reward for staying within the boudnaries of the road

An Object iD with a specified color has been assigned to ground
The center pixel of the bottom camera is used to detect the color of the ground below it
and checks if its still on the street or not


Each subsequent mention of a folder is an either an improvement a different focus or both:

Fast_Training and Slow_Training:
The two directories Fast Training and Slow Training are not seperate but are meant to be used together.
The fast_training folder rewards the drone for increasing its velocity
When the drone is trained on just the fast_training it requires far too much training to learn to control its own speed in any one direction
Instead curriculum learning will be used, first the drone will be trained to reach the goal slowly, then will be rewarded for learning to
reach its target quicker.


Optuna_optimized:
Used optuna on slow_training model to find best hyperparameters

Surrounding Cameras:
Training drone to use all 4 direction cameras to train it to avoid obstacles around it

Passing_to_GPU:
Pass the images to the gpu for faster processing
